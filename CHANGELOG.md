# Changelog

All notable changes to FortiAnalyzer MCP Server will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.7.0] - 2026-07-03

Full-codebase correctness and security-hardening review: uniform identifier validation, config/env parsing fix, task-state handling, device-filter classification, report custom time windows, and deployment hardening.

### Fixed
- **ICMP entries in `get_policy_port_analysis` no longer leak the application service name into `type_code`.** When a FortiGate SD-WAN SLA health-check pings a DNS server, the ICMP (proto=1) packet is logged with `service="DNS"`; the analyzer parsed `service` for the ICMP type/code (per #9) but, for a value that is not `PING` or `icmp/T/C`, emitted `type_code: "service=DNS"` verbatim — an inconsistent, non-type/code value (verified live: policy 38 returned `service=DNS`, policy 46 correctly returned `type=3/code=3`). Unrecognized ICMP `service` values (and malformed `icmp/…` strings) now record as `type=unknown` so `type_code` always means an ICMP type/code. Closes [#37](https://github.com/rstierli/fortianalyzer-mcp/issues/37).
- **`MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` no longer crashes startup when set in the documented comma-separated format.** pydantic-settings JSON-decodes `list[str]` env fields, so `MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS=faz.example.com,proxy.internal` (or even a single host) raised `SettingsError` before the server started. The field is now annotated `NoDecode` with a before-validator that accepts a comma-separated string or a JSON array. Requires pydantic-settings >= 2.3.0 (floor bumped in `pyproject.toml`).
- **`wait_for_task` / `list_tasks(filter_state=...)` handle the numeric task `state` FAZ actually returns.** `/task/task` reports `state` as an int (done=4, error=5, ...); `wait_for_task` called `.lower()` on it (AttributeError on every poll) and `list_tasks` compared the string name against the numeric field (silently empty). Both now normalize via a shared state-code map; string states keep working, and unknown `filter_state` values are rejected instead of matching nothing.
- **`build_device_filter` no longer misroutes hostnames that start with a serial prefix.** Names like `FGT-HQ-01`/`FG-BRANCH` were sent as `devid`, making every log/traffic/pcap search for that device silently return zero rows. The devid branch now requires a full serial match, including a new VM-serial form (`FMG-VM...`, `FAZ-VMTM...`).
- **FortiView tools route the device filter through `build_device_filter`.** `run_fortiview`/`get_fortiview_data` sent everything (including serials) as `devname`, silently scoping the query to nothing for serial input. The `All_Device` default is preserved.
- **Reports: custom `"start|end"` time ranges no longer silently cover the wrong period.** Previously `run_report`/`run_and_wait_report` sent `time-period: "other"` with no window, so FAZ ran the report over the layout's default period (verified live on 7.6.7 and 8.0.0). Now: `run_and_wait_report` configures the window on the layout's schedule config object (`update /config/adom/{adom}/sql-report/schedule/{layout_id}`: numeric `time-period` 16 = "other" + `period-start`/`period-end` in FortiOS timedate `"HH:MM yyyy/mm/dd"`, the format FAZ verifiably parses), verifies it by read-back (an unaccepted window aborts the run with an error), HOLDS it until generation completes — FAZ reads the schedule at generation time, not submission (verified live) — then restores the previous period. The success payload echoes `requested_window`, checks the shared schedule wasn't changed mid-run, and carries an explicit warning until generator consumption of the stored window is confirmed live (`tools/verify_custom_window.py --phase mech` discriminates the remaining run-mechanism hypotheses). `run_report` (fire-and-forget) rejects custom ranges outright, since it cannot hold the shared schedule through generation. Unknown presets (e.g. `"14-day"`) raise a validation error instead of silently becoming `last-7-days`, and the report device filter uses `build_device_filter` instead of hardcoding `devid`.
- **Progress percentages returned as strings no longer break polling.** `get_fortiview_data`, `fetch_fortiview`, and the `run_and_wait_report` wait loop coerce `percentage`/`percent` numerically (shared `coerce_num`, moved from `log_tools` to `utils.responses`) instead of comparing `"50" >= 100` (TypeError swallowed into a generic error).
- **Transient-error retries no longer replay non-idempotent writes.** A network error after FAZ accepted an ADD/SET/EXEC (e.g. `create_incident`, `add_device`) could double-execute it on retry. Transient retry is now gated to GET requests; the reconnect-once path for expired sessions stays enabled for all verbs (an expired session means the request never executed).
- **`run_fortiview` / `run_ioc_rescan` return an error when FAZ supplies no TID** instead of a success payload with `tid: null` that fails on the next call.
- **`fetch_fortiview` reports completion state** (`complete`, `percentage`, warning) so a fetch before the scan reaches 100% is no longer indistinguishable from final results (partial top-N).
- **`search_ips_logs` no longer fabricates `total` when FAZ omits the match count.** It reports `total: null` + `total_is_known: false` + a truncation warning instead of `total = len(logs)`, which made a limit-capped page look like an exact count.
- **`search_traffic_logs(policy_id=0)` now filters on the implicit-deny policy** (`if policy_id:` dropped id 0).
- **`search_devices(connection_status=...)` uses the DVMDB enum** (unknown=0, up=1, down=2) and rejects unrecognized values; `"down"` previously matched *unknown* devices.
- **`get_system_timezone` caches a definitive negative result**, eliminating one extra `/sys/status` round-trip per relative-range query on FAZ builds that don't report a parseable timezone. Probe failures (FAZ unreachable) are not cached.
- **List-form JSON-RPC results with a string `status` no longer crash `_raw_request_once`** (`AttributeError` on `"ok".get(...)`); string statuses are tolerated the same way the dict-form branch already did.
- **Repeated failed `connect()` calls no longer leak a `requests.Session` per attempt** (the half-built pyfmg instance is cleared on failure).
- **docker-compose healthcheck works again**: it invoked `curl`, which `python:3.12-slim` does not ship, overriding the image's working python healthcheck and marking the container permanently unhealthy.

### Security
- **Uniform identifier validation across all tool modules.** `adom` (and `get_adom`'s `name`) is now validated in every tool — report/event/incident/ioc/system/fortiview/log tools previously interpolated it into the JSON-RPC url path unvalidated; device names in `get_device`/`get_device_info`/`list_device_vdoms` and a new `validate_incident_id` for `get_incident`/`update_incident` close the same url-path-injection class. `fetch_fortiview` now validates `view_name` like its siblings.
- **Documented limit/offset/poll bounds are enforced**: `get_alerts`/`get_alert_logs`/`get_incidents` clamp to 1-2000 and offset >= 0; FortiView limits clamp to 1-1000; `wait_for_task` clamps `poll_interval` >= 1 (a zero/negative value tight-looped against the shared client) and all wait-loop timeouts cap at 3600s.
- **`redact()` also masks quoted-key JSON/dict forms** (`"adm_pass": "x"`), not just `key=value`.
- **docker-compose hardening**: port published on loopback by default (`MCP_BIND_ADDRESS`, new env var), `cap_drop: ALL`, `no-new-privileges`, read-only rootfs with `/tmp` tmpfs, `pids_limit`. Dockerfile pins the `uv` image to a version tag; CI workflow gets an explicit least-privilege `permissions` block.
- **Docs corrected**: `SECURITY.md` referenced `ALLOWED_OUTPUT_DIRS` (correct name: `FAZ_ALLOWED_OUTPUT_DIRS`); `docs/SECURITY_REVIEW.md` is marked as a historical document whose findings/line references predate the current codebase.
- **Bulk device add/delete responses flag their async-task semantics** — counts reflect submission; a warning points to `wait_for_task(task_id)` for per-device results.

### Added
- Regression test suites `tests/test_validation_consistency.py` and `tests/test_bugfix_regressions.py` covering every fix above.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-06-16

Real fix for the policy `total_hits` under-report ([#30](https://github.com/rstierli/fortianalyzer-mcp/issues/30), variant 2): sum the per-slice `total-count`s the breakdown already fetches instead of a separate `limit=1` whole-window logsearch. Removes the v2.4.1 clamp's reason to exist (kept as a guard) and decides exactness per slice. PR [#35](https://github.com/rstierli/fortianalyzer-mcp/pull/35) by [@inxbit](https://github.com/inxbit). Closes [#30](https://github.com/rstierli/fortianalyzer-mcp/issues/30). 559 unit tests pass. Live-verified on FAZ 7.6.7 and 8.0.0 (137 invariant checks per version).

### Fixed
- **`get_policy_traffic_profile` / `get_policy_port_analysis` / `get_policy_protocol_summary` no longer report `total_hits` below `observed_hits`, and now report it correctly when the window is fully scanned.** The total came from `_query_policy_total_count`, a `limit=1` logsearch whose `total-count` short-circuits the instant the first match is found, so it returned a tiny scanned-block count rather than the real total (observed 44 vs 4,000 on heavy policies, and as low as 37 vs 1,151 in a real audit). That function is deleted. `_query_policy_logs_bounded` now sums the `total-count` each per-slice breakdown search already returns and discards. Slices are contiguous and non-overlapping and each slice's `total-count` is at least the rows it returned, so the summed `total_hits` is `>= observed_hits` by construction. This also drops one FAZ logsearch per policy (was `slice_count + 1`, now `slice_count`).
- **`is_exact` ("complete") is decided per slice and can no longer mislabel an unproven result.** A result is exact only when every slice reported a `total-count` equal to the rows it returned and below the fetch limit, i.e. every slice was fully scanned. The previous rule was `truncated_slices == 0`, which would call a result "complete" even when a slice timed out or omitted its total (0 rows, not counted as truncated). Exactness is now computed from the raw per-slice proof, so an aggregate over/under-count cancellation cannot fabricate completeness.

### Changed
- The v2.4.1 defensive clamp (`max(authoritative, observed_hits)` at `_bounded_metadata`) is kept as a belt rather than removed: with variant 2 the summed total is `>= observed_hits` by construction so it is normally a no-op, but if a slice ever under-reports below its own rows the clamp still holds the schema contract and now logs a warning instead of silently flooring. The clamped display value is never used to decide `is_exact`.
- Tool docstrings, `README.md`, and `docs/INTERNAL_ARCHITECTURE.md` now describe `total_hits` as the sum of per-slice `total-count`s (a floor that is at least `observed_hits`), not an "authoritative whole-window" count.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-06-16

Type safety + internals refactor and a session-expired re-login signal. PRs [#33](https://github.com/rstierli/fortianalyzer-mcp/pull/33) and [#34](https://github.com/rstierli/fortianalyzer-mcp/pull/34) by [@inxbit](https://github.com/inxbit). 554 unit tests pass.

### Changed
- **Blocking `pyfmg` calls are off the asyncio event loop.** All FortiAnalyzer JSON-RPC calls (login, logout, raw POST, generic verbs) are wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread` and serialized by a per-client `asyncio.Lock`. The lock is required because `pyfmg` shares one `requests.Session` + req-id counter that is not thread-safe; one in-flight FAZ request per host matches the prior behavior, but the loop is no longer blocked. `connect()` re-checks `self._connected` inside the lock to avoid double-login on concurrent callers.
- **`ValidationError` consolidated into a single class.** The canonical type now lives in `utils.errors`, subclasses both `FortiAnalyzerError` and `ValueError`, and is re-exported from `utils.validation` so every existing import (`from utils.validation import ValidationError`) keeps working. Tools doing `except ValidationError` still match (single class, MRO correct); tools doing `except ValueError` still match too (the new class is-a `ValueError`). The FAZ `-5` error path that maps to `utils.errors.ValidationError` is now catchable by tools that previously only caught the `validation.py` variant — a strict improvement.
- **Client typing tightened.** The `_request_dict` / `_raw_request_dict` helpers add a single `cast(dict[str, Any], ...)` per shape — pure mypy hint, single cast point, no runtime assertion. Filter params widened from `list[str]` to `list[Any]` so callers can pass nested `[field, op, value]` triples that FAZ actually accepts — the prior annotation was wrong. One `# type: ignore[call-arg]` added in `config.py` for pydantic-settings env loading, commented.
- **FAZ error code `-11` now reclassified as a session-expired signal.** Long-lived clients that hit `-11` ("No permission for the resource") on FortiAnalyzer 8.0.0 — which raises it when an established session goes stale — re-login exactly once via the existing serialized `_force_reconnect` path instead of retrying the dead session. The reconnect path inherits the v2.0.1 lock + generation counter, so concurrent callers don't race. Reconnect budget is hard-coded to a single retry per request; a second `-11` after re-login raises immediately. `ERROR_CODE_MAP[-11]` updated from `TimeoutError("Task timeout")` to `PermissionError("No permission for the resource")` so the raised exception class matches the new semantics.

### Added
- `FortiVoice` (`FV`) serial prefix added to `_DEVICE_SERIAL_PREFIXES` so FV serials route through the device-name filter path. Previously, `DEVICE_SERIAL_PATTERN` accepted FV serials but `_DEVICE_SERIAL_PREFIXES` did not list `FV`, silently building a filter that matched nothing. Fix bundled with the typing PR since it lives in the same `validation.py` reach.
- `asyncio.get_event_loop()` → `asyncio.get_running_loop()` in the `log_tools` polling loop — correct for Python 3.12+.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-06-16

Defensive clamp at the policy-port-analysis response boundary so `total_hits >= observed_hits` always holds. Closes the user-facing symptom of [#30](https://github.com/rstierli/fortianalyzer-mcp/issues/30) — under-reported totals were breaking policy-audit decisions on heavy-traffic policies. 552 unit tests pass.

### Fixed
- **`get_policy_port_analysis` (and the other bounded-policy tools) no longer return `total_hits` smaller than `observed_hits`.** The authoritative total comes from a `limit=1` logsearch whose `total-count` short-circuits unreliably on heavy traffic — on a 7-day window for a busy policy we observed `total_hits: 37` while the breakdown itself counted `observed_hits: 1149`. The response-assembly site at `_bounded_metadata` now clamps `resolved_total_hits = max(authoritative, observed_hits)` so the schema contract holds. `total_hit_source` continues to report `logsearch_total-count` since that is where the value came from; the clamp only defends against the under-report failure mode. This is a defensive shim and will become a no-op once `_query_policy_total_count` is reworked to sum per-slice totals (variant 2 in the [#30](https://github.com/rstierli/fortianalyzer-mcp/issues/30) issue body).

## [2.4.0] - 2026-06-16

Security hardening + correctness fixes shipped together. PRs [#31](https://github.com/rstierli/fortianalyzer-mcp/pull/31) (security) and [#32](https://github.com/rstierli/fortianalyzer-mcp/pull/32) (correctness) by [@inxbit](https://github.com/inxbit). 552 unit tests pass.

### Security
- **DVMDB credential blobs are masked on device reads.** `list_devices`, `get_device`, `search_devices`, and `get_device_info` now route through `sanitize_for_logging` so the `adm_pass` field returns `***REDACTED***` instead of the cleartext credential blob. The blob was a leak, not a documented field — agents that previously parsed `adm_pass` will see the redaction placeholder.
- **PCAP ZIP extraction enforces a 50MB cap against crafted ZIP headers.** Decompression in `get_pcap_by_session`, `download_pcap_by_url`, and `search_and_download_pcaps` now reads with a hard `size+1` byte limit rather than trusting `ZipInfo.file_size` (which is attacker-controlled). Defends against ZIP-bomb / oversized-archive attacks at the FAZ-API boundary.
- **HTTP transport bearer-token comparison uses SHA-256 + `hmac.compare_digest`.** The previous compare leaked token length via early-exit timing. Both tokens are now hashed to 32 bytes before constant-time compare, removing the length side-channel.
- **Mutation tools validate `adom` / `device_name` / `severity` / `status` against allowlists** before reaching the FAZ. `add_device`, `delete_device`, `create_incident`, and `update_incident` reject malformed inputs at the tool boundary with a structured error envelope.

### Fixed
- **`acknowledge_ioc_events` was 100% broken** — the tool was passing `ioc_ids=` to the client method, whose signature is `event_ids=`. Every call raised `TypeError`. Corrected.
- **`get_fortiview_data` no longer returns truncated top-N data.** The old completion guard exited on the first non-empty `data` payload, before polling reached `percentage=100`. The fetch now waits for full completion; older FAZ builds that don't emit `percentage` are treated as complete (back-compat preserved).
- **`run_and_wait_report` verifies completion via `report_fetch` instead of assuming success.** Previously, any time the report tid disappeared from the running list, the wrapper returned success — including on report failure or a startup race where the tid hadn't appeared yet. Now confirms `state == "generated"` (success); `pending`/`running` keeps polling; anything else is an error.
- **`run_ioc_rescan` passes the correctly-shaped device filter.** The tool was passing a raw string where the client expected `list[dict[str, str]]` — a guaranteed type mismatch. Now routes through the shared `build_device_filter()` helper.

### Added
- `tests/test_security_regressions.py` — pins each of the four security claims with fake clients that mirror real signatures so kwarg drift fails the test.
- `tests/test_correctness_regressions.py` — pins the four correctness fixes; the IOC ack test would fail if `ioc_ids=` were reintroduced; the FortiView test explicitly asserts the fetch poll loop iterates more than once.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-06-15

New `list_report_templates` tool backed by FortiAnalyzer's dedicated `/template/list` endpoint. PR [#29](https://github.com/rstierli/fortianalyzer-mcp/pull/29). 535 unit tests pass.

### Added
- **`list_report_templates(adom)` tool.** Returns the list of report templates available in an ADOM via the spec-defined `/template/list` JSON-RPC endpoint, rather than scraping `list_report_layouts` and filtering by name. The dedicated endpoint returns templates with their canonical IDs / names / language / category, so callers building report-run workflows can pick a template by ID without first listing layouts.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-06-15

Align logsearch poll-before-fetch with the FortiAnalyzer JSON-API spec — drop the non-spec `/logsearch/count/{tid}` endpoint and non-spec `progress-percent` field. PR [#28](https://github.com/rstierli/fortianalyzer-mcp/pull/28). Closes [#27](https://github.com/rstierli/fortianalyzer-mcp/issues/27). 589 unit tests pass; cross-verified against FAZ 7.6.7 and 8.0.0 (same MCP code, both hosts produce the same shape).

### Fixed
- **Log search no longer hits a non-spec count endpoint that 8.0 rejects.** The 2.0.1 poll-before-fetch contract probed readiness via `/logsearch/count/{tid}` and the non-spec field names `progress-percent` / `total-logs` / `scanned-logs`. That endpoint is not in the FortiAnalyzer JSON-API spec — on 8.0 it returns an error which cascaded into `search_timeout`, slot exhaustion, and the FortiView fallback. Readiness now polls the standard `/logsearch/get/{tid}?limit=0` and the spec-defined `percentage` field — behavior identical on 7.6.7 and 8.0.0, confirmed end-to-end against both versions.
- **Same slot-leak fix still in force.** The shared budget, semaphore-bounded concurrency, deadline-bounded count/fetch, and shielded best-effort `logsearch_cancel` on non-delivered exits all survive — only the readiness signal changed.

### Removed
- The non-spec `/logsearch/count/{tid}` probe path (and its `count_unsupported` fallback flag), the non-spec `progress-percent` / `scanned-logs` readiness fields, and the supporting client helpers. The poll-before-fetch contract now uses only documented spec calls.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-06-12

Fail closed: the streamable-HTTP transport now refuses to start without `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` unless the operator explicitly opts out with `MCP_ALLOW_NO_AUTH=true`. PR [#25](https://github.com/rstierli/fortianalyzer-mcp/pull/25) by [@inxbit](https://github.com/inxbit). Closes [#20](https://github.com/rstierli/fortianalyzer-mcp/issues/20). 544 unit tests pass.

### Changed
- **The HTTP transport now fails closed when `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` is unset.** The streamable-HTTP server fronts the full tool surface (including device add/delete and PCAP download), so it previously could serve everything unauthenticated if the token was simply forgotten. `run_http()` now refuses to start without a token and exits with a message that names the fix, unless the operator explicitly opts out with `MCP_ALLOW_NO_AUTH=true` (logged at CRITICAL; intended only for a trusted, isolated bind such as 127.0.0.1 behind a gateway). **Upgrade note:** a deployment that ran on a `0.0.0.0` bind without a token must now set either `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` or `MCP_ALLOW_NO_AUTH=true` to keep starting.

### Added
- `MCP_ALLOW_NO_AUTH` setting (default `false`) — the explicit opt-out for running HTTP without a token. 4 tests cover token-set start, no-token fail-closed, empty-token fail-closed, and the explicit opt-out.

## [2.1.1] - 2026-06-11

Security hardening: redact remaining tool error messages + warn when TLS verification is disabled. PR [#23](https://github.com/rstierli/fortianalyzer-mcp/pull/23) by [@inxbit](https://github.com/inxbit). Closes [#22](https://github.com/rstierli/fortianalyzer-mcp/issues/22). 540 unit tests pass.

### Security
- **Tool error responses no longer echo raw exception text.** The dvm/event/fortiview/incident/ioc/pcap/report/system and log tools returned `str(e)` directly in error responses, bypassing the `redact()` the log/traffic tools already applied; all such sites now route through `redact()` so echoed-back parameters and FortiAnalyzer internals (token, host, session id) cannot leak into a tool response.
- **Warning when TLS verification is disabled.** Connecting with `FORTIANALYZER_VERIFY_SSL=false` now logs a one-time `WARNING` at connect time — the FortiAnalyzer API token and all log/PCAP data are exposed to man-in-the-middle interception — pointing operators toward trusting the FAZ CA instead.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-06-10

Stable baseline `total` across pagination handles, plus drift observability and ADOM-bound handles. PR [#19](https://github.com/rstierli/fortianalyzer-mcp/pull/19) by [@inxbit](https://github.com/inxbit). 540 unit tests pass; live-verified end-to-end on a 7.6.7 appliance across 1d/7d/30d windows.

### Changed
- **`query_logs` / `fetch_more_logs` now report a stable baseline `total` for a pagination session.** A FortiAnalyzer logsearch re-runs per page over a frozen window and the appliance re-counts `total-count` between pages, so the reported `total` could wobble within one pagination session (observed on 7.6.7: 230071 → 230741). `total` is now held as the handle's first-page baseline; `has_more` is decoupled from it and pages against the best observed figure so a short page never stops paging early. See [ADR-0002](docs/adr/0002-baseline-total-for-pagination-handle.md).

### Added
- `page_total` (live per-page count), `total_count_stability` (`single_observation` | `stable` | `drifted` | `unknown`), `total_drift_detected`, `total_delta`, and `has_more_basis` on log-query responses; an `adom_mismatch` guard binding a pagination handle to its ADOM. 11 regression tests against a drift-capable fake.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-06-09

Reliability hardening for FortiAnalyzer 7.6.7. PR [#18](https://github.com/rstierli/fortianalyzer-mcp/pull/18) by [@inxbit](https://github.com/inxbit). 529 unit tests pass; live-verified end-to-end on a 7.6.7 appliance.

### Fixed
- **Log search no longer drains the appliance search-slot pool on FortiAnalyzer 7.6.7.** The shared page runner used to call `logsearch_fetch` immediately after `logsearch_start`, before the async search had finished. On 7.6.7 that premature fetch returned an incomplete page **and reaped the single-use tid**, so the runner re-issued a fresh `logsearch_start` ~once/second for 60s — no search ever completed, and the ~60 starts drained the appliance's search-slot pool (`query_logs` / `fetch_more_logs` / bounded policy slices / PCAP searches all returned zero rows / `search_timeout` / `No available slot for searching`). Replaced with a shared `_run_logsearch_page` whose contract is **poll-before-fetch**: `ensure_connected → logsearch_start → poll logsearch_count` (a cheap GET that does NOT reap the tid) until the scan is complete, then `logsearch_fetch` exactly once. Readiness is `progress-percent >= 100` OR (`total-logs > 0` AND `scanned-logs >= total-logs`) — `matched-logs` is deliberately not a readiness signal.
- **Server lifecycle no longer disconnects the shared client around every HTTP request.** `FastMCP(lifespan=...)` with `stateless_http=True` runs the lifespan per request/session, so the global `faz_client` was being connected then disconnected around every call, dropping the session out from under concurrent requests. Lifecycle ownership moved to `run_http`'s `app_lifespan` (Starlette-level) and `run_stdio`'s coroutine — a single owner for the server's lifetime.
- **Concurrent reconnects no longer race to tear down a revived session.** `_force_reconnect` is now serialized by an `asyncio.Lock` with a generation counter — when several concurrent requests all hit a dropped session, only the first re-logs in; the others observe the bumped generation and return without clearing the revived `_fmg`.
- **Relative time-range windows no longer silently miss recent logs after an upgrade.** FAZ interprets the naive `time-range` timestamps a logview search sends against its LogView ingest clock, which can drift from system "now" — notably after a version upgrade — so a relative window like `"1-hour"` anchored on system-now could land *ahead* of the newest ingested log and return zero rows even though traffic exists. Relative windows are now anchored on the appliance's LogView clock via a probe chain (`logfiles_state → logstats → faz_tz → naive`), with ±2-day / +400-day plausibility guards. Custom absolute ranges (`"start|end"`) skip the probe.

### Added
- **Bounded concurrent in-flight searches across every call site in this process.** A global `asyncio.Semaphore(LOGSEARCH_CONCURRENCY_LIMIT=4)` wraps the page runner, so `query_logs`, `fetch_more_logs`, the policy fan-out, and PCAP searches share one cap. Because a search now **holds** a slot for its whole budget (poll-before-fetch), the appliance-slot guard lives at the shared runner rather than only in the policy fan-out.
- **Shared bounded recovery budget across all reissue causes.** A single `MAX_SEARCH_REISSUES=3` budget covers invalid-tid during count, the invalid-tid race during fetch, and the "premature 100%" empty page — so a reaping appliance can spin at most `1 + MAX_SEARCH_REISSUES = 4` starts per page and is bounded by the wall-clock deadline as well. No new start or fetch is issued past the deadline.
- **Bounded `logsearch_count` and `logsearch_fetch` awaits.** Both calls are wrapped in `asyncio.wait_for` against the remaining wall-clock budget, so a stuck count/fetch cannot extend the slot hold past the search's own timeout.
- **Shielded best-effort cleanup-cancel on non-delivered exits.** Any path that leaves a started search un-fetched (count/fetch error, cancellation, deadline) issues a `logsearch_cancel` under `asyncio.shield(asyncio.wait_for(..., 2.0))` so a cancelled request still dispatches the cancel before the `CancelledError` propagates. If even the dispatch cannot run, the appliance reaps the single-use task on its own.
- **`MAX_SEARCH_TIMEOUT = 300s` upper bound on a single search's wall-clock budget.** Prevents a caller passing a huge timeout from monopolizing a concurrency slot.
- **Fallback for older builds without `logsearch/count`.** A clear unsupported-endpoint error (e.g. `Unknown URL`) falls back to a single direct fetch on the same tid and caches the per-client flag so subsequent searches skip the count probe entirely. Invalid-tid and timeout errors deliberately do NOT trigger the fallback.
- **`time_basis_source` and `clock_skew_seconds` on log-query responses.** Surfaces the LogView clock detection outcome (`logfiles_state` / `logstats` / `faz_tz` / `naive`) so callers can audit which clock anchored the window and by how much it skewed from FAZ "now".
- **`tests/test_logsearch_runner.py`** (646 lines): regression coverage that makes the fakes raise invalid-tid on fetch-before-complete, so the "exactly one start" assertions would fail against the old fetch-first runner. Pins the no-slot-exhaustion contract, the shared-budget cap, deadline behavior across 5 separate branches, leak cleanup, concurrency-cap saturation, and the count-unsupported fallback.

### Security
- **Defense-in-depth path-traversal guard on the report raw-save branch.** `save_report` now asserts the resolved output file stays within the validated output directory, mirroring the ZIP-extract guard added in 1.3.0.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-06-09

Breaking change: policy `estimated_total_hits` / `estimate_available` removed in favor of authoritative `total_hits` + `total_hits_is_known` + `total_hit_source`. See **Changed** section. PR [#17](https://github.com/rstierli/fortianalyzer-mcp/pull/17) by [@inxbit](https://github.com/inxbit).

### Fixed
- **`fetch_more_logs` no longer fails with "Invalid tid".** A FortiAnalyzer logsearch task id is single-use — the first fetch delivers the requested `offset`/`limit` slice plus `total-count`, and the appliance then reaps the task, so any second fetch on the same tid returns `Invalid tid` regardless of ADOM (verified on a live FAZ 7.4.x appliance). `fetch_more_logs` now reconstructs and re-runs the original query (same ADOM, logtype, filter, device, and absolute time window) at the requested offset, which the appliance returns in a stable order, so paging is correct and consistent. An unknown/expired pagination handle returns a structured `error="tid_invalid_or_expired"` error with a recommendation to re-run `query_logs`.
- **`total` is now accurate.** `query_logs` previously read a non-existent `total-lines` key (so `total` always equalled the page `count`); it now reads `total-count` from the fetch response and reports `total_is_known=false` when unavailable.
- **FAZ timezone detection across builds.** `get_system_timezone()` now reads the IANA name from either the `TZ` or `Time Zone` field of `/sys/status`.
- **Reliable bounded policy queries on slow searches.** The policy traffic tools now re-issue a fresh search per slice instead of re-fetching a single-use FortiAnalyzer `tid` (the same single-use-tid model as `query_logs`). Previously, if a slice — or the new whole-window total-count, most likely on large 7/30-day windows — returned incomplete on the first fetch, the next poll hit a reaped tid and failed that policy with `policy_query_failed`. Re-issues are bounded by the existing wall-clock timeout.

### Added
- **Reusable pagination handle + richer `query_logs` output.** `query_logs` returns `tid` (a reusable pagination handle), `has_more`, `next_offset`, `total`, `total_is_known`, `warnings`, `timezone`, `time_basis`, the resolved `time_range`, and echoes `adom`/`logtype`/`filter`/`device`/`offset`/`limit` for auditability. `fetch_more_logs` returns the same self-describing shape.
- **Automatic reconnect-once.** Log tools call `FortiAnalyzerClient.ensure_connected()` before issuing requests, so an idle-closed session is transparently revived instead of surfacing a raw "Not connected. Call connect() first." error.
- **Bounded transient retry.** Client requests retry transient FAZ/network errors (internal error, task timeout, network) with exponential backoff; validation and invalid-tid errors are never retried.
- **`cancel_log_search`** now releases the in-process pagination handle (the appliance task is usually already reaped, so the appliance-side cancel is best-effort).
- **One structured error envelope.** Every tool error path returns `{status:"error", error:<machine code>, message, operation, retry_count}` (plus `adom`/`logtype`/`tid` where relevant). Codes: `validation_error`, `invalid_time_range`, `invalid_tid`, `tid_invalid_or_expired`, `search_timeout`, `network_error`, `faz_operation_failed`; `retry_count` is the number of transient request retries the client performed.
- **`warnings` + `next_offset` on log queries.** `query_logs`/`fetch_more_logs` include a `warnings` list (clamped `limit`, unknown `total`, undetected timezone, or a high-volume result set that points to the bounded policy tools) and a `next_offset` to drive the next page.
- **Policy-tool audit metadata.** `get_policy_traffic_profile`/`get_policy_port_analysis`/`get_policy_protocol_summary` now return top-level `adom`, resolved `time_range`, and `timezone`, plus a per-policy `filter`; the analysis window is resolved once and shared by the bounded slices and the whole-window total-count query.
- **Authoritative policy `total_hits`.** The three policy tools now report `total_hits` from a whole-window FortiAnalyzer log-search `total-count` for the same policy/action/device/time filter, with `total_hits_is_known` and `total_hit_source` (`"logsearch_total-count"` when authoritative, `"observed_rows"` when it fell back to fetched rows). The port/protocol/service/application breakdowns and residuals still describe observed rows only. The total-count is best-effort: if it fails, the per-policy observations are still returned with `total_hit_source="observed_rows"`.
- **Custom time-range validation.** A custom `"start|end"` range is validated for `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` format and `start <= end`, returning a clear `invalid_time_range` error instead of failing deep in slicing.

### Changed
- A completed logsearch task discovered reaped mid-poll is re-issued (bounded) so a slow search that finishes between polls still returns its results instead of failing.
- Response fields were finalized before release: `total_known` → `total_is_known`, `returned_offset`/`returned_limit` → `offset`/`limit`, and the error key `error_type` → `error` (a stable machine code). These only ever existed in pre-release builds.
- **Policy `estimated_total_hits`/`estimate_available` removed.** The optional best-effort FortiView `policy-hits` estimate (shipped through 1.3.0) is replaced by the authoritative whole-window `total_hits` above. Consumers that read `estimated_total_hits`/`estimate_available` should switch to `total_hits` + `total_hits_is_known` + `total_hit_source`.
- **`is_exact`/`analysis_mode` honest about partial breakdowns.** A policy result is `is_exact=true`/`"complete"` only when no slice was truncated **and** `total_hits == observed_hits`; when the authoritative total exceeds the observed rows the result is `"bounded_sample"` with the narrow-the-window recommendation, so a partial breakdown is never labelled complete.

### Security
- **Secret redaction in errors and logs.** Tool error messages and the logged search filter pass through a redaction-then-truncation helper, so tokens/session ids are masked and oversized internal errors are bounded before reaching a response or log. The raw `filter=` argument on `query_logs` is documented as a caller-controlled expert escape hatch (the `search_*` helpers remain validated/sanitized).

## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-29

First stable release — graduated from beta.

### Security
- **Log-query filter injection fixed** ([#16](https://github.com/rstierli/fortianalyzer-mcp/issues/16)): caller-supplied filter fields in the IPS/PCAP and traffic/security/event log search tools (`srcip`, `dstip`, `srcport`, `dstport`, `severity`, `action`, `level`, `subtype`, `cve`, `attack_name`, `session_id`) are now validated/sanitized before being interpolated into FAZ filter expressions. IPs are checked as IP/CIDR, ports as integers, enums against allowlists, and free-text fields reject quote/operator/boolean characters — preventing a caller from rewriting the filter to widen log scope. Filter operators and quoting are unchanged, so legitimate queries behave identically.
- **PCAP-by-URL validation** ([#16](https://github.com/rstierli/fortianalyzer-mcp/issues/16)): `download_pcap_by_url` / `get_pcap_file` now validate that `pcapurl` is an internal FAZ resource reference and reject arbitrary external URL schemes before forwarding to FortiAnalyzer.
- **Archive-extraction path containment** ([#16](https://github.com/rstierli/fortianalyzer-mcp/issues/16)): PCAP and report ZIP extraction now asserts each resolved path stays within the intended output directory (defense-in-depth on top of the existing basename handling).

### Changed
- **Stability promotion:** no functional changes beyond the security hardening above. Shipped example configs (`docker-compose.yml`, `.env.example`) and README now default to `FORTIANALYZER_VERIFY_SSL=true` with CA-import guidance, document a strong `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` for HTTP mode, and warn that running HTTP transport without a token leaves all tools unauthenticated. The server's runtime defaults are unchanged (backward compatible).

## [1.2.1-beta] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed
- **Relative time-range queries no longer silently miss logs when client and FAZ have different system timezones** ([#13](https://github.com/rstierli/fortianalyzer-mcp/issues/13)). FAZ accepts naive `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` timestamps and interprets them in its own system TZ. The MCP previously called `datetime.now()` (caller-local) and formatted naive, so when client and FAZ disagreed by N hours every relative window smaller than N silently returned zero logs. Discovered with a fresh FAZ 8.0.0 GA defaulting to US/Pacific while the client lived in CEST — `search_traffic_logs(time_range="1-hour")` was searching a window 9 hours in the future. The MCP now reads FAZ's IANA TZ from `get_system_status`, caches it on the client, and computes "now" in UTC → FAZ-local before formatting. Custom absolute ranges (`"start|end"`) skip the TZ lookup.
- **Unknown `time_range` keys now raise `ValueError` instead of silently falling back to 1-hour or 24-hour.** Typos like `"30-min"` or `"5-min"` no longer produce wrong-but-plausible windows.

### Added
- **More relative-range presets supported uniformly across all tools:** `now / 5-min / 15-min / 30-min / 1-hour / 2-hour / 6-hour / 12-hour / 24-hour / 1-day / 2-day / 7-day / 30-day / 90-day`. Previously each of the 8 tool files supported a slightly different subset.
- **FortiAnalyzer 8.0.x support** — tested against 8.0.0 GA (build 0105).
- **`FortiAnalyzerClient.get_system_timezone()`** — public async method that returns the cached FAZ IANA timezone as a `zoneinfo.ZoneInfo`.

### Changed
- **Consolidated 8 duplicate `_parse_time_range` implementations** into a single `utils/time_range.py` (single source of truth). Each tool now uses a thin async wrapper that delegates to the shared utility with the FAZ-cached TZ.

## [1.2.0-beta] - 2026-04-24

### Changed
- **Policy traffic analysis is now bounded for large windows** — traffic analysis tools scan a fixed number of log slices per request, return observed results instead of attempting unbounded raw-log reconstruction, and only set `is_exact=true` when every queried slice is below the log fetch limit
- **Port analysis metadata expanded** — policy results now include bounded-analysis metadata such as `analysis_mode`, `observed_hits`, `slices_scanned`, `truncated_slices`, `log_limit_per_slice`, and optional FortiView `estimated_total_hits`
- **`is_exact` ownership moved to `_bounded_metadata`** — `_aggregate_port_analysis` no longer computes `is_exact`; the caller sets it based on slice truncation, which is more accurate for multi-slice queries
- **FortiView estimates run concurrently** with bounded log queries instead of sequentially, reducing wall-clock time on slow FortiAnalyzer instances

### Added
- Best-effort FortiView `policy-hits` estimates as optional metadata (non-fatal if unavailable)
- Tests for `_extract_policy_hit_count` edge cases
- Tool-level bounded tests for `get_policy_traffic_profile` and `get_policy_protocol_summary`

### Credits
- Bounded slicing approach contributed by [@inxbit](https://github.com/inxbit) (PR [#11](https://github.com/rstierli/fortianalyzer-mcp/pull/11))

## [1.1.2-beta] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- **`is_exact` in port analysis** — `_aggregate_port_analysis` now correctly computes `is_exact` based on whether the log query hit the result limit, instead of always returning `True`
