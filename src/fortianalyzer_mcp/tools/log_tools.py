    Note on pagination: a FortiAnalyzer logsearch task id is single-use (it is
    reaped after the first fetch). The `tid` returned here is a reusable handle
    backed by an in-process record of the search parameters; fetch_more_logs
    re-runs the same query at a new offset. For a fixed time window the result
    order is stable, so paging is consistent.

    Example:
        >>> # Get last hour of traffic logs
        >>> result = await query_logs(logtype="traffic", time_range="1-hour")
        >>> print(f"Found {result['count']} logs")
